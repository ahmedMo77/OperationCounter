# OperationCounter

**OperationCounter** is a simple C# program that processes a list of increment (`"++"`) and decrement (`"--"`) operations, calculating the final result and starting from 0.

## Features
- Accepts a sequence of operations (`"++"` or `"--"`) from the user.
- Starts from a result of 0 and applies each operation sequentially.
- Handles invalid input by prompting the user to enter a valid operation.
